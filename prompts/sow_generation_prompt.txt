You are an expert Statement of Work (SOW) generator. 
Your goal is to create structured SOW data in JSON format based on minimal input, considering different user personas and job types across various industries.

For each combination of **Job Type** and **User Persona** (defined below), generate a JSON object representing a sample SOW. Each job type should have its own JSON file, with all JSON objects for that job type contained within a single JSON array.

Each JSON object should have the following keys:
* `job_type`: The specific job type.
* `persona`: The name of the user persona.
* `sow_title`: A brief, descriptive title for the SOW.
* `introduction`: A short paragraph providing context.
* `objectives`: An array of clearly stated, measurable objectives.
* `scope_of_work`: An array of specific tasks and deliverables included.
* `deliverables`: An array of tangible outputs.
* `timeline_milestones`: An object where keys are milestone names and values are estimated completion dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
* `acceptance_criteria`: An array of criteria for deliverable acceptance.
* `reporting_communication`: A string describing reporting frequency and methods.
* `assumptions`: An array of critical assumptions.
* `exclusions`: An array of tasks or deliverables NOT included.

**Formatting and Instructions:**
1. **Output Structure:** Generate a separate JSON file for each job type. Each file should contain a single JSON array with all JSON objects for that job type. For example:
   ```json
   [
       { "job_type": "Example Job Type", "persona": "Example Persona", ... },
       { "job_type": "Example Job Type", "persona": "Another Persona", ... }
   ]
   ```
2. **File Naming:** Name each file based on the job type, using snake_case. For example, `software_development.json` for "Software Development: Building a customer relationship management (CRM) system."
3. **Field Content:** Keep the content within each field concise but informative. Use professional language suitable for business contexts.
4. **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting, capitalization, and structure across all JSON objects.
5. **Date Format:** Use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format for all dates in the `timeline_milestones` field.
6. **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not repeat identical content across different JSON objects unless necessary.

**Job Types:**
* **Technology:**
  * "Software Development: Building a customer relationship management (CRM) system."

**User Personas:**
* "Efficient Manager": Focused on clear deliverables, timelines, and cost.
* "Detail-Oriented Engineer": Interested in technical specs and thorough documentation.
* "Budget-Conscious Startup Founder": Prioritizes essential features and budget.
* "Risk-Averse Enterprise Architect": Emphasizes security and standards.
* "Agile Project Lead": Values flexibility and iterative progress.
* "Creative Marketer": Seeks innovative and visually appealing solutions.
* "Data-Driven Analyst": Prefers metrics and measurable outcomes.
* "Customer-Centric Sales Leader": Focused on client satisfaction and retention.
* "Process-Oriented Operations Manager": Values efficiency and repeatable processes.
* "Visionary Executive": Interested in long-term strategy and scalability.

Generate **one** JSON object for **each** combination of Job Type and User Persona. 
For example, one JSON object for "Software Development" and "Efficient Manager", another for "Digital Marketing" and "Creative Marketer", and so on. Ensure each job type's JSON objects are saved in a separate JSON file.

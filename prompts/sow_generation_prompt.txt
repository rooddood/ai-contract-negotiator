You are an expert Statement of Work (SOW) generator. 
Your goal is to create structured SOW data in JSON format based on minimal input, considering different user personas and job types across various industries.

For each combination of **Job Type** and **User Persona** (defined below), generate a JSON object representing a sample SOW. All generated JSON objects should be contained within a single JSON array.

Each JSON object should have the following keys:
* `job_type`: The specific job type.
* `persona`: The name of the user persona.
* `sow_title`: A brief, descriptive title for the SOW.
* `introduction`: A short paragraph providing context.
* `objectives`: An array of clearly stated, measurable objectives.
* `scope_of_work`: An array of specific tasks and deliverables included.
* `deliverables`: An array of tangible outputs.
* `timeline_milestones`: An object where keys are milestone names and values are estimated completion dates (YYYY-MM-DD).
* `acceptance_criteria`: An array of criteria for deliverable acceptance.
* `reporting_communication`: A string describing reporting frequency and methods.
* `assumptions`: An array of critical assumptions.
* `exclusions`: An array of tasks or deliverables NOT included.

**Formatting and Instructions:**
1. **Output Structure:** All JSON objects must be contained within a single JSON array. For example:
   ```json
   [
       { "job_type": "Example Job Type", "persona": "Example Persona", ... },
       { "job_type": "Another Job Type", "persona": "Another Persona", ... }
   ]
   ```
2. **Field Content:** Keep the content within each field concise but informative. Use professional language suitable for business contexts.
3. **Consistency:** Ensure consistent formatting, capitalization, and structure across all JSON objects.
4. **Date Format:** Use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format for all dates in the `timeline_milestones` field.
5. **Avoid Redundancy:** Do not repeat identical content across different JSON objects unless necessary.

Generate **one** JSON object for **each** combination of Job Type and User Persona. 
For example, one JSON object for "Software Development" and "Efficient Manager", another for "Digital Marketing" and "Creative Marketer", and so on.
Then combine all of these generated JSON objects and combine them into one single json file called generated_sow_db.json
